Courtney Giannini, MD, PhD (she/her) is a combined Post-doctoral Fellow in the Cole Lab in the Department of Bioinformatics at the University of Colorado and a clinical Fellow of Pediatric Nephrology at Colorado Children's Hospital.

Dr. Giannini grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and obtained her dual MD/PhD degrees in the University of Cincinnati's Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). Dr Giannini recieved her PhD in Environmental Epidemiology. Her dissertation work examined the association between active sunscreen ingredient benzophenone-3 (oxybenzone) and sex hormones during pubertal milestones in young females. 

Dr. Giannini is inspired by the question "How do genes and environment conspire to increase an individuals risk for kidney disease?" Her work in the Cole Lab will focus on investigating gene environment interactions in chronic kidney disease. Favorite parts of her job include data analysis, getting to know the wonderful children with kidney disease she has the honor of serving and collaborating with her lab mates and co-fellows. 

In her free time, Dr. Giannini spends time with her husband who is a Critical Care Fellow at University of Colorado and her 2 year old son. Together they enjoy taking taking their dogs to the park, fishing for brook trout and camping every weekend they are not on call.
